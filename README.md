You can save this script to a file, for example, install.sh, make it executable with chmod +x install.sh, and then run it with ./install.sh in the terminal. The script will install all the required packages, create the .env files, create a database and user, and store the installation details in a text file called installation-details.txt.

Note that you should replace <db_name>, <db_user>, and <db_password> with appropriate values for your setup. Also, make sure to modify the nginx virtual host configuration for phpmyadmin if you are using a different PHP version.
